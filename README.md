# Clock Web Development Project

A simple, responsive clock created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The clock displays the current time and updates every second.

## Features

- Displays current time in **hours**, **minutes**, and **seconds**
- Updates automatically every second
- Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes
- Clean and simple UI using modern CSS

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the clock
- **CSS**: Styling for a clean and responsive design
- **JavaScript**: Logic for real-time updates and functionality

## How It Works

- The time is updated using the JavaScript `setInterval()` function, which recalculates the current time every second.
- The clock is displayed in a clean format (HH:MM:SS).
- You can further customize the styling and format as needed.
